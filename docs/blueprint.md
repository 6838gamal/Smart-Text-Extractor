- OCR Engine: Extract text from scanned PDFs and images using OCR technology. Leverage a service to perform OCR, sending them the images to be processed. Output the text in a readable format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate violet (#807DFF) to suggest high tech along with neutrality.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), providing a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Light blue (#7DC5FF) to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a balance of modern and neutral readability.
- Use minimalist icons that represent file types, actions (summarize, translate, export), and options (settings, dark mode).
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for file upload, processing options, and results display.
- Use subtle animations for loading states, progress updates, and transitions between sections to enhance user experience.
